Backend Development
1. Project Setup:


Create a project directory and initialize it using npm init.

Install required dependencies like Express.js, Mongoose, body-parser, and cors.

2. Database Configuration:


Set up a MongoDB database (locally or using a cloud service like MongoDB Atlas).

Create collections for:

Users (storing user information, account type)

Projects (project details, budget, skills required)

Applications (freelancer proposals, rate, portfolio link)

Chat (communication history for each project)

Freelancer (extended user details with skills, experience, ratings)


3. Express.js Server:


Create an Express.js server to handle HTTP requests and API endpoints.

Configure body-parser to parse request bodies and cors for cross-origin requests.


4. API Routes:


Define separate route files for user management, project listing, application handling, chat functionality, and freelancer profiles.

Implement route handlers using Express.js to interact with the database:

User routes: registration, login, profile management.

Project routes: project creation, listing, details retrieval.

Application routes: submit proposals, view applications.

Chat routes: send and receive messages within projects.

Freelancer routes: view and update profiles, showcase skills.


5. Data Models:


Define Mongoose schemas for each data entity:

User schema

Project schema

Application schema

Chat schema

Freelancer schema (extends User schema with skills, experience)

Create Mongoose models to interact with the MongoDB database.

Implement CRUD operations for each model to manage data.




6. User Authentication:


Implement user authentication using JWT or session-based methods.

Create routes and middleware for user registration, login, and logout.

Use authentication middleware to protect routes requiring user authorization (e.g., applying for projects).


7. Project Management:


Allow clients to post projects with details and budget.

Enable freelancers to browse projects, search by skills, and submit proposals.

Implement a system for clients to review applications and choose freelancers.


8. Secure Communication & Collaboration:


Integrate a secure chat system within projects for communication between clients and freelancers.

Allow file attachments and feedback exchange to facilitate collaboration.
